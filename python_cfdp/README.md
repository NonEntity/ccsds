# Python CFDP Utilities

This directory contains a minimal Python translation of a few classes from the
Java CFDP module.  Only the helper routines in `common` have been ported as an
example.  The full CFDP implementation available under `eu.dariolucia.ccsds.cfdp`
contains many additional classes which are not yet provided in Python.
